Before next commit:
- ensure line endings are okay

Some time:
- work more on 64-bit stuff
- check up on the sufficiency of the configure script
- move all switch statements to use enums (instead of defines) where
  possible
- some graphics fail to draw; investigate why (tracked in issue #3 on GH)
- something happened to the text color for the high scores; they are now
  practically illegible against their background
- add better visual feedback for the hit detection
- silence certain warnings
- re-implement deprecated APIs to be non-deprecated
- handle window re-sizing
- handle window activation and de-activation
